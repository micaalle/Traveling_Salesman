Approximate Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This C program uses Prim's Algorithm to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and generates an approximate solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by performing a preorder Depth-First Search (DFS) on the MST.

Features
 - Prim’s Algorithm: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree.
 - TSP Approximation: Creates a Hamiltonian cycle using DFS traversal of the MST.

Based on the pseudoCode found in "Introduction To Algorithms Third Edition" 
- chapter 35 for TSP
- chapter 23 for Prim's algorithms
